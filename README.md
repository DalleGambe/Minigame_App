If audio doesn't work on the installed PWA, try refreshing the page.
At the moment, the audio only plays in the installed PWA or Firefox browser. 
We are sorry for the inconvenience.
Overall, this was a fun project but due to time constraints I couldn't finish it before the deadline.
While I didn't have time to update them, all of the (except for rock paper scissors) minigames pages are under construction and will not work.
